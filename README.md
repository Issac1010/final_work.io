In terms of electronic design and software development, the project successfully integrated controllers, sensors and actuators, and developed control algorithms as well as path planning and visual recognition systems, providing solid technical support for the robot. Through testing in real-life environments such as swamps and wetlands, the robot demonstrated the effectiveness and environmental adaptability of its design.


The main conclusions of this study through the structural design, mechanical property analysis, and related experiments of the amphibious underwater robot are as follows:


1. complete the three-dimensional modeling of the amphibious robot through SOLIDWORKS, design the main body of the underwater robot into a completely symmetrical shape, which makes it possible to reduce the consideration of some working conditions when analyzing it, and put forward the overall design of the robot and complete the model construction of the prototype.


2. The hydrodynamic analysis of the simplified robot is completed by Fluent, and the distribution of traces and vortices generated around it is observed. At the same time, the finite element analysis of the conduit paddle was carried out separately, the stress distribution was counted under different speed conditions, graphs were plotted and the relevant data were analyzed, and it was concluded that the static pressure, dynamic pressure and shear stress increased with the increase of flow velocity in the flow field.


Overall, this project demonstrates not only the power of interdisciplinary teamwork but also the potential of engineering design to solve environmental monitoring and ecological protection problems. Through this double-helix amphibious robot project, the team expects to provide an efficient, economical and easy-to-maintain solution for environmental monitoring and research, while also contributing innovative designs and applications to the development of amphibious robot technology. As the project continues, we expect the final results to have a profound impact in the field of environmental science and engineering.
